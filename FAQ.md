## macOS

### How do I take a screen grab?

In macOS you can take a screen grab with a keyboard combination.

**Command-Shift-3** takes a screen grab of your **entire screen**.

**Command-Shift-4** takes a screen grab of a **selected area**.

Pressing the **space bar** after you've entered selection mode will allow you to **capture a window**.

Your image files will save to your desktop.

Add a **Control** to either of the above methods and you will **copy your screen grab to the clipboard** rather than create a file.
